This is the python version of the Rascal XXPDF system.

If only the standard feature set is used it is fully compatible with xxpdf. 

If the additional functionality is used then Libre office and or a version of wkhtmltopdf is needed.

Wkhtmltopdf can be obtained from http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list
The mostly static version is a better choice than the ubuntu dist version because it allows multiple documents and page footers.
http://wkhtmltopdf.googlecode.com/files/wkhtmltopdf-0.11.0_rc1-static-i386.tar.bz2
or
http://wkhtmltopdf.googlecode.com/files/wkhtmltopdf-0.11.0_rc1-static-amd64.tar.bz2
No copy of wkhtmltopdf is included here because its 12Meg in size and easy to get from the above URLs.

Fix issue 123
