5 Heere bigynneth the Tale of the Wyf of Bathe.
6 
7 In th'olde dayes of the Kyng Arthour,
8 Of which that Britons speken greet honour,
9 
10 All was this land fulfild of fayerye.
11 The elf-queene, with hir joly compaignye,
12 Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede.
13 This was the olde opinion, as I rede;
14 I speke of manye hundred yeres ago.
15 
16 But now kan no man se none elves mo,
17 For now the grete charitee and prayeres
18 Of lymytours and othere hooly freres,
19 That serchen every lond and every streem,
20 As thikke as motes in the sonne-beem,
21 
22 Blessynge halles, chambres, kichenes, boures,
23 Citees, burghes, castels, hye toures,
24 Thropes, bernes, shipnes, dayeryes,
25 This maketh that ther been no fayeryes.
26 For ther as wont to walken was an elf,
27 
28 Ther walketh now the lymytour hymself
29 In undermeles and in morwenynges,
30 And seyth his matyns and his hooly thynges
31 As he gooth in his lymytacioun.
32 Wommen may go saufly up and doun.
33 
34 In every bussh or under every tree
35 Ther is noon oother incubus but he,
36 And he ne wol doon hem but dishonour.
37 And so bifel it that this kyng Arthour
38 Hadde in his hous a lusty bacheler,
39 
40 That on a day cam ridynge fro ryver;
41 And happed that, allone as she was born,
42 He saugh a mayde walkynge hym biforn,
43 Of whiche mayde anon, maugree hir heed,
44 By verray force he rafte hir maydenhed;
45 
46 For which oppressioun was swich clamour
47 And swich pursute unto the kyng Arthour,
48 That dampned was this knyght for to be deed,
49 By cours of lawe, and sholde han lost his heed -
50 Paraventure, swich was the statut tho -
51 
52 But that the queene and othere ladyes mo
53 So longe preyeden the kyng of grace,
54 Til he his lyf hym graunted in the place,
55 And yaf hym to the queene al at hir wille,
56 To chese wheither she wolde hym save or spille.
57 
58 The queene thanketh the kyng with al hir myght,
59 And after this thus spak she to the knyght,
60 Whan that she saugh hir tyme, upon a day,
61 "Thou standest yet," quod she, "in swich array
62 That of thy lyf yet hastow no suretee.
63 
64 I grante thee lyf, if thou kanst tellen me
65 What thyng is it that wommen moost desiren.
66 Be war and keep thy nekke-boon from iren!
67 And if thou kanst nat tellen it anon,
68 Yet shal I yeve thee leve for to gon
69 
70 A twelf-month and a day to seche and leere
71 An answere suffisant in this mateere;
72 And suretee wol I han, er that thou pace,
73 Thy body for to yelden in this place."
74 Wo was this knyght, and sorwefully he siketh;
75 
76 But what! He may nat do al as hym liketh.
77 And at the laste he chees hym for to wende,
78 And come agayn right at the yeres ende,
79 With swich answere as God wolde hym purveye;
80 And taketh his leve, and wendeth forth his weye.
81 
82 He seketh every hous and every place
83 Where as he hopeth for to fynde grace
84 To lerne what thyng wommen loven moost;
85 But he ne koude arryven in no coost
86 Wher as he myghte fynde in this mateere
87 
88 Two creatures accordynge in-feere.
89 Somme seyde, wommen loven best richesse,
90 Somme seyde honour, somme seyde jolynesse,
91 Somme riche array, somme seyden lust abedde,
92 And oftetyme to be wydwe and wedde.
93 
94 Somme seyde, that oure hertes been moost esed
95 Whan that we been yflatered and yplesed.
96 He gooth ful ny the sothe, I wol nat lye,
97 A man shal wynne us best with flaterye;
98 And with attendance and with bisynesse
99 
100 Been we ylymed, bothe moore and lesse.
101 And somme seyen, how that we loven best
102 For to be free, and do right as us lest,
103 And that no man repreve us of oure vice,
104 But seye that we be wise, and nothyng nyce.
105 
106 For trewely, ther is noon of us alle,
107 If any wight wol clawe us on the galle,
108 That we nel kike; for he seith us sooth;
109 Assay, and he shal fynde it that so dooth.
110 For, be we never so vicious withinne,
111 
112 We sol been holden wise, and clene of synne.
113 And somme seyn, that greet delit han we
114 For to been holden stable and eek secree,
115 And in o purpos stedefastly to dwelle,
116 And nat biwreye thyng that men us telle.
117 
118 But that tale is nat worth a rake-stele,
119 Pardee, we wommen konne no thyng hele.
120 Witnesse on Myda, - wol ye heere the tale?
121 Ovyde, amonges othere thynges smale,
122 Seyde, Myda hadde under his longe heres
123 
124 Growynge upon his heed two asses eres,
125 The whiche vice he hydde, as he best myghte,
126 Ful subtilly from every mannes sighte,
127 That, save his wyf, ther wiste of it namo.
128 He loved hire moost and trusted hir also;
129 
130 He preyede hire, that to no creature
131 She sholde tellen of his disfigure.
132 She swoor him nay, for al this world to wynne,
133 She nolde do that vileynye or synne,
134 To make hir housbonde han so foul a name.
135 
136 She nolde nat telle it for hir owene shame.
137 But nathelees, hir thoughte that she dyde,
138 That she so longe sholde a conseil hyde;
139 Hir thoughte it swal so soore aboute hir herte
140 That nedely som word hir moste asterte;
141 
142 And sith she dorste telle it to no man,
143 Doun to a mareys faste by she ran,
144 Til she cam there, hir herte was a fyre,
145 And as a bitore bombleth in the myre,
146 She leyde hir mouth unto the water doun:
147 
148 "Biwreye me nat, thou water, with thy soun,"
149 Quod she, "to thee I telle it and namo,
150 Myn housbonde hath longe asses erys two!
151 Now is myn herte al hool, now is it oute.
152 I myghte no lenger kepe it, out of doute."
153 
154 Heere may ye se, thogh we a tyme abyde,
155 Yet out it moot, we kan no conseil hyde.
156 The remenant of the tale, if ye wol heere,
157 Redeth Ovyde, and ther ye may it leere.
158 This knyght, of which my tale is specially,
159 
160 Whan that he saugh he myghte nat come therby,
161 This is to seye, what wommen love moost,
162 Withinne his brest ful sorweful was the goost.
163 But hoom he gooth, he myghte nat sojourne;
164 The day was come that homward moste he tourne.
165 
166 And in his wey it happed hym to ryde,
167 In al this care under a forest syde,
168 Wher as he saugh upon a daunce go
169 Of ladyes foure and twenty, and yet mo;
170 Toward the whiche daunce he drow ful yerne,
171 
172 In hope that som wysdom sholde he lerne.
173 But certeinly, er he came fully there,
174 Vanysshed was this daunce, he nyste where.
175 No creature saugh he that bar lyf,
176 Save on the grene he saugh sittynge a wyf -
177 
178 A fouler wight ther may no man devyse.
179 Agayn the knyght this olde wyf gan ryse,
180 And seyde, "Sire knyght, heer forth ne lith no wey.
181 Tel me what that ye seken, by your fey!
182 Paraventure it may the bettre be,
183 
184 Thise olde folk kan muchel thyng," quod she.
185 "My leeve mooder," quod this knyght, "certeyn
186 I nam but deed, but if that I kan seyn
187 What thyng it is, that wommen moost desire.
188 Koude ye me wisse, I wolde wel quite youre hire."
189 
190 "Plight me thy trouthe, heere in myn hand," quod she,
191 "The nexte thyng that I requere thee,
192 Thou shalt it do, if it lye in thy myght,
193 And I wol telle it yow, er it be nyght."
194 "Have heer my trouthe," quod the knyght, "I grante."
195 
196 "Thanne," quod she, "I dar me wel avante
197 Thy lyf is sauf; for I wol stonde therby,
198 Upon my lyf, the queene wol seye as I.
199 Lat se which is the proudeste of hem alle,
200 That wereth on a coverchief or a calle,
201 
202 That dar seye nay of that I shal thee teche.
203 Lat us go forth withouten lenger speche."
204 Tho rowned she a pistel in his ere,
205 And bad hym to be glad and have no fere.
206 Whan they be comen to the court, this knyght
207 
208 Seyde he had holde his day, as he hadde hight,
209 And redy was his answere, as he sayde.
210 Ful many a noble wyf, and many a mayde,
211 And many a wydwe, for that they been wise,
212 The queene hirself sittynge as a justise,
213 
214 Assembled been, his answere for to heere;
215 And afterward this knyght was bode appeere.
216 To every wight comanded was silence,
217 And that the knyght sholde telle in audience
218 What thyng that worldly wommen loven best.
219 
220 This knyght ne stood nat stille as doth a best,
221 But ot his questioun anon answerde
222 With manly voys, that al the court it herde:
223 "My lige lady, generally," quod he,
224 "Wommen desiren to have sovereynetee
225 
226 As wel over hir housbond as hir love,
227 And for to been in maistrie hym above.
228 This is youre mooste desir, thogh ye me kille.
229 Dooth as yow list, I am heer at youre wille."
230 In al the court ne was ther wyf, ne mayde,
231 
232 Ne wydwe, that contraried that he sayde,
233 But seyden he was worthy han his lyf.
234 And with that word up stirte the olde wyf,
235 Which that the knyght saugh sittynge in the grene.
236 "Mercy," quod she, "my sovereyn lady queene,
237 
238 Er that youre court departe, do me right.
239 I taughte this answere unto the knyght,
240 For which he plighte me his trouthe there,
241 The firste thyng I wolde of hym requere,
242 He wolde it do, if it lay in his myght.
243 
244 Bifor the court thanne preye I thee, sir knyght,"
245 Quod she, "that thou me take unto thy wyf,
246 For wel thou woost that I have kept thy lyf.
247 If I seye fals, sey nay, upon thy fey!"
248 This knyght answerde, "Allas and weylawey!
249 
250 I woot right wel that swich was my biheste!
251 For Goddes love, as chees a newe requeste!
252 Taak al my good, and lat my body go!"
253 "Nay, thanne," quod she, "I shrewe us bothe two!
254 For thogh that I be foul, and oold, and poore,
255 
256 I nolde for al the metal, ne for oore,
257 That under erthe is grave, or lith above,
258 But if thy wyf I were, and eek thy love."
259 "My love?" quod he, "nay, my dampnacioun!
260 Allas, that any of my nacioun
261 
262 Sholde evere so foule disparaged be!"
263 But al for noght, the ende is this, that he
264 Constreyned was, he nedes moste hir wedde;
265 And taketh his olde wyf, and gooth to bedde.
266 Now wolden som men seye, paraventure,
267 
268 That for my necligence I do no cure
269 To tellen yow the joye and al th'array,
270 That at the feeste was that ilke day;
271 To whiche thyng shortly answere I shal:
272 I seye, ther nas no joye ne feeste at al;
273 
274 Ther nas but hevynesse and muche sorwe.
275 For prively he wedde hir on a morwe,
276 And al day after hidde hym as an owle,
277 So wo was hym, his wyf looked so foule.
278 Greet was the wo the knyght hadde in his thoght,
279 
280 Whan he was with his wyf abedde ybroght;
281 He walweth and he turneth to and fro.
282 His olde wyf lay smylynge everemo,
283 And seyde, "O deere housbonde, benedicitee,
284 Fareth every knyght thus with his wyf, as ye?
285 
286 Is this the lawe of Kyng Arthures hous?
287 Is every knyght of his so dangerous?
288 I am youre owene love and youre wyf;
289 I am she which that saved hath youre lyf.
290 And certes, yet dide I yow nevere unright;
291 
292 Why fare ye thus with me this firste nyght?
293 Ye faren lyk a man had lost his wit.
294 What is my gilt? For Goddes love, tel it,
295 And it shal been amended, if I may."
296 "Amended," quod this knyght, "allas! nay! nay!
297 
298 It wol nat been amended nevere mo;
299 Thou art so loothly and so oold also,
300 And therto comen of so lough a kynde,
301 That litel wonder is thogh I walwe and wynde.
302 So wolde God, myn herte wolde breste!"
303 
304 "Is this," quod she, "the cause of youre unreste?"
305 "Ye certeinly," quod he, "no wonder is!"
306 "Now, sire," quod she, "I koude amende al this,
307 If that me liste, er it were dayes thre,
308 So wel ye myghte bere yow unto me.
309 
310 But for ye speken of swich gentillesse
311 As is descended out of old richesse,
312 That therfore sholden ye be gentil men,
313 Swich arrogance nis nat worth an hen.
314 Looke who that is moost vertuous alway,
315 
316 Pryvee and apert, and moost entendeth ay
317 To do the gentil dedes that he kan,
318 Taak hym for the grettest gentil man.
319 Crist wole we clayme of hym oure gentillesse,
320 Nat of oure eldres for hire old richesse.
321 
322 For thogh they yeve us al hir heritage,
323 For which we clayme to been of heigh parage,
324 Yet may they nat biquethe, for no thyng
325 To noon of us hir vertuous lyvyng,
326 That made hem gentil men ycalled be,
327 
328 And bad us folwen hem in swich degree.
329 Wel kan the wise poete of Florence,
330 That highte Dant, speken in this sentence.
331 Lo in swich maner rym is Dantes tale:
332 `Ful selde upriseth by his branches smale
333 
334 Prowesse of man, for God of his goodnesse,
335 Wole, that of hym we clayme oure gentillesse.'
336 For of oure eldres may we no thyng clayme
337 But temporel thyng, that man may hurte and mayme.
338 Eek every wight woot this as wel as I,
339 
340 If gentillesse were planted natureelly
341 Unto a certeyn lynage doun the lyne,
342 Pryvee nor apert, thanne wolde they nevere fyne
343 To doon of gentillesse the faire office,
344 They myghte do no vileynye or vice.
345 
346 Taak fyr, and ber it in the derkeste hous
347 Bitwix this and the mount of Kaukasous,
348 And lat men shette the dores and go thenne;
349 Yet wole the fyr as faire lye and brenne
350 As twenty thousand men myghte it biholde;
351 
352 His office natureel ay wol it holde,
353 Up peril of my lyf, til that it dye.
354 Heere may ye se wel, how that genterye
355 Is nat annexed to possessioun,
356 Sith folk ne doon hir operacioun
357 
358 Alwey, as dooth the fyr, lo, in his kynde.
359 For God it woot, men may wel often fynde
360 A lordes sone do shame and vileynye,
361 And he that wole han pris of his gentrye,
362 For he was boren of a gentil hous,
363 
364 And hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous,
365 And nel hym-selven do no gentil dedis,
366 Ne folwen his gentil auncestre that deed is,
367 He nys nat gentil, be he duc or erl;
368 For vileyns synful dedes make a cherl.
369 
370 For gentillesse nys but renomee
371 Of thyne auncestres for hire heigh bountee,
372 Which is a strange thyng to thy persone.
373 Thy gentillesse cometh fro God allone.
374 Thanne comth oure verray gentillesse of grace,
375 
376 It was no thyng biquethe us with oure place.
377 Thenketh hou noble, as seith Valerius,
378 Was thilke Tullius Hostillius,
379 That out of poverte roos to heigh noblesse.
380 Reedeth Senek, and redeth eek Boece,
381 
382 Ther shul ye seen expres that it no drede is,
383 That he is gentil that dooth gentil dedis.
384 And therfore, leeve housbonde, I thus conclude:
385 Al were it that myne auncestres weren rude,
386 Yet may the hye God, and so hope I,
387 
388 Grante me grace to lyven vertuously.
389 Thanne am I gentil whan that I bigynne
390 To lyven vertuously, and weyve synne.
391 And ther as ye of poverte me repreeve,
392 The hye God, on whom that we bileeve,
393 
394 In wilful poverte chees to lyve his lyf.
395 And certes every man, mayden or wyf,
396 May understonde that Jesus, hevene kyng,
397 Ne wolde nat chesen vicious lyvyng.
398 Glad poverte is an honeste thyng, certeyn,
399 
400 This wole Senec and othere clerkes seyn.
401 Who so that halt hym payd of his poverte,
402 I holde hym riche, al hadde he nat a sherte.
403 He that coveiteth is a povre wight,
404 For he wolde han that is nat in his myght;
405 
406 But he that noght hath, ne coveiteth have,
407 Is riche, although ye holde hym but a knave.
408 Verray poverte, it syngeth proprely;
409 Juvenal seith of poverte myrily:
410 `The povre man, whan he goth by the weye,
411 
412 Bifore the theves he may synge and pleye.'
413 Poverte is hateful good, and, as I gesse,
414 A ful greet bryngere out of bisynesse;
415 A greet amender eek of sapience
416 To hym that taketh it in pacience.
417 
418 Poverte is this, although it seme alenge,
419 Possessioun, that no wight wol chalenge.
420 Poverte ful ofte, whan a man is lowe,
421 Maketh his God and eek hymself to knowe.
422 Poverte a spectacle is, as thynketh me,
423 
424 Thurgh which he may hise verray freendes see.
425 And therfore, sire, syn that I noght yow greve,
426 Of my poverte namoore ye me repreve.
427 Now sire, of elde ye repreve me,
428 And certes, sire, thogh noon auctoritee
429 
430 Were in no book, ye gentils of honour
431 Seyn, that men sholde an oold wight doon favour,
432 And clepe hym fader for youre gentillesse;
433 And auctours shal I fynden, as I gesse.
434 Now, ther ye seye that I am foul and old,
435 
436 Than drede you noght to been a cokewold;
437 For filthe and eelde, al so moot I thee,
438 Been grete wardeyns upon chastitee;
439 But nathelees, syn I knowe youre delit,
440 I shal fulfille youre worldly appetit."
441 
442 "Chese now," quod she, "oon of thise thynges tweye:
443 To han me foul and old til that I deye,
444 And be to yow a trewe humble wyf,
445 And nevere yow displese in al my lyf;
446 Or elles ye wol han me yong and fair,
447 
448 And take youre aventure of the repair
449 That shal be to youre hous, by cause of me,
450 Or in som oother place may wel be.
451 Now chese yourselven wheither that yow liketh."
452 This knyght avyseth hym and sore siketh,
453 
454 But atte laste, he seyde in this manere:
455 "My lady and my love, and wyf so deere,
456 I put me in youre wise governance.
457 Cheseth yourself, which may be moost plesance
458 And moost honour to yow and me also.
459 
460 I do no fors the wheither of the two;
461 For, as yow liketh, it suffiseth me."
462 "Thanne have I gete of yow maistrie," quod she,

473 And but I be to-morn as fair to seene

491 And grace t'overbyde hem that we wedde;
492 And eek I praye Jesu shorte hir lyves
493 That nat wol be governed by hir wyves;
494 And olde and angry nygardes of dispence,
